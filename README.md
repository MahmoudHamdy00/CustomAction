# Extending your bot with code

## Add custom actions in C#

### In this article

In Bot Framework Composer, [actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/concept-dialog?tabs=v2x#action) are the main
contents of a [trigger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/concept-dialog?tabs=v2x#trigger). Actions help maintain
conversation flow and instruct bots on how to fulfill user requests.
Composer provides different types of actions, such as **Send a
response**, **Ask a question**, and **Create a condition**. Besides
these built-in actions, you can create and customize your own actions in
Composer.

This article shows you how to include a custom action named
`MultiplyDialog`.

### Note

Composer currently supports the C\# runtime and JavaScript (preview)
Adaptive Runtime.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of [actions](https://docs.microsoft.comcomposer/concept-dialog?tabs=v2x#action) in Composer.
- [A basic bot built using Composer](https://docs.microsoft.com/composer/quickstart-create-bot?tabs=v2x).
- [Bot Framework CLI 4.10](https://botbuilder.myget.org/feed/botframework-cli/package/npm/@microsoft/botframework-cli) or later.

## Setup the Bot Framework CLI tool

The Bot Framework CLI tools include the *bf-dialog* tool which will
create a *schema file* that describes the built-in and custom
capabilities of your bot project. It does this by merging partial schema
files included with each component with the root schema provided by Bot
Framework.

Open a command line and run the following command to install the Bot
Framework tools:

    npm i -g @microsoft/botframework-cli

## Key points

This C\# sample consists of the following:

- A Composer project targeted for Dotnet.  This can be any Composer project.  One that already exists, or a new one you create.  This sample provides an Empty Bot for demonstration purposes. The important points are:
  - A project dependency on the MultiplyDialog project
  - appsettings has been updated to include MultiplyDialog for the Adaptive Runtime.  This allows the Adaptive Runtime to load this component at startup.

- A project containing the custom action, implemented as a BotComponent
  - The custom action code [MultiplyDialog.cs](MultiplyDialog/Action/MultiplyDialog.cs) class, which defines the business logic of the custom action. In this example, two numbers passed as inputs are multiplied, and the result is the output.

  - The custom action schema [MultiplyDialog.schema](MultiplyDialog/Schemas/MultiplyDialog.schema), which describes the operations available.

    [Bot Framework Schemas](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/tree/master/schemas)
    are specifications for JSON data. They define the shape of the data
    and can be used to validate JSON. All of Bot Framework's Adaptive Dialogs
    are defined using [this](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/master/schemas/component/v1.0/component.schema) JSON schema. The schema files tell Composer
    what capabilities the bot runtime supports. Composer uses the [uischema](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/master/schemas/ui/v1.0/ui.schema)
    to help it render the user interface when using the action in a
    dialog.

  - A BotComponent, [MultiplyDialogBotComponent.cs](MultiplyDialog/MultiplyDialogBotComponent.cs) for component registration.  BotComponents are loaded by your bot (specifically by Adaptive Runtime), and made available to Composer.

    **Note** You can create a custom action without implementing BotComponent.  However, the Component Model in Bot Framework allows for easier reuse and is only slightly more work.  In a BotComponent, you add the needed services and objects via Dependency Injection, just as you would in Startup.cs.

## Outline of adding a custom action
------------------------------

1. Create a new project for the custom action.  Use the settings in [csproj](MultiplyDialog/Microsoft.Bot.Components.Samples.MultiplyDialog.csproj) as a template.  This project contains important settings that are required when publishing your custom action.

1. Implement your custom action by subclassing Dialog, and implementing BeginDialogAsync. See [MultiplyDialog.cs](MultiplyDialog/Actions/MultiplyDialog.cs)

1. Create the [MultiplyDialog.schema](MultiplyDialog/Schemas/MultiplyDialog.schema)

1. Create your BotComponent per [MultiplyDialogBotComponent.cs](MultiplyDialog/MultiplyDialogBotComponent.cs).

1. Add Existing project to the solution.

1. In the bot project, add a project reference to the MultiplyDialog project.

1. Run the command `dotnet build` on the project to
    verify if it passes build after adding custom actions to it. You
    should be able to see the "Build succeeded" message after this
    command.

1. Edit {bot}\settings\appsettings.json to include the BotComponent in the `runtimeSettings/components` list.

   ```json
   "runtimeSettings": {
      "components": [
        {
          "name": "CustomAction.MultiplyDialog"
        }
      ]
   }
   ```

## Update the schema file

Now you have customized your bot, the next step is to update the
`sdk.schema` file to include the `MultiplyDialog.Schema` file.  This makes your custom action available for use in Composer.

**You only need to perform these steps when adding new code extensions, or when the Schema for a component changes.**

1) Navigate to the `C:\CustomAction\CustomAction\schemas` folder. This
folder contains a PowerShell script and a bash script. Run either one of
the following commands:

       ./update-schema.ps1

    **Note**

    The above steps should generate a new `sdk.schema` file inside the
    `schemas` folder.

1) Search for `MultiplyDialog` inside the `CustomAction\schemas\sdk.schema` file and
    validate that the partial schema for [MultiplyDialog.schema](assets/MultiplyDialog.schema) is included in `sdk.schema`.

### Tip

Alternatively, you can select the `update-schema.sh` file inside the
`CustomAction\schemas` folder to run the bash script. You can't click and run the
`powershell` file directly.

## Test

Open the bot project in Composer and you should be able to test your
added custom action.  If the project is already loaded, return to `Home` in Composer, and reload the project.

1. Open your bot in Composer. Select a trigger you want to associate this custom action with.

2. Select **+** under the trigger node to see the actions menu. You
   will see **Custom Actions** added to the menu. Select **Multiply**
   from the menu.

3. On the **Properties** panel on the right side, enter two numbers in
   the argument fields: **Arg1** and **Arg2**. Enter **dialog.result**
   in the **Result** property field. For example, enter `99` for each field.

4. Add a **Send a response** action. Enter `99*99=${dialog.result}` in the Language Generation editor.

5. Select **Restart Bot** to test the bot in the Emulator. Your bot
   will respond with the test result.
